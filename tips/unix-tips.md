### command line
  * option-click to move anywhere on the current line
  * Michael Hartl's [command line tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) is excellent

### other
* [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) is a better grep; supports Perl's (powerful) regex engine
* [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z) is a really nice tool for navigating to recently/commonly used dirs; eg `z my-latest-app`
